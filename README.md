## Env variables

In order to launch the project you need to obtain the API keys from Binance and Telegram

- For Binance - register [here](http://bit.ly/binance-telegram-bot) (referral link). Then generate the keys on [API Management](https://www.binance.com/en/my/settings/api-management) page.
- For Telegram Bot - get the bot token from the [BotFather](https://t.me/botfather)

## How to run the project?

First install the npm dependencies by running `npm install`. Then start the project by running `npm start`. After these steps you can send the commands to the Telegram bot to get the prices for cryptocurrencies, for example, `/start` (for getting the real time price of Bitcoin).
